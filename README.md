This package consists of a function to lookup coordinates of the best packing
of n equal spheres in a [-x, x]^3 cube of edge length 2x, where best is
definied as maximizing the minimum L2 distance among points. The solutions are
provided by [Hugo Pfoertner](http://www.randomwalk.de/sequences/a084824.txt)

This function can be used effectively for scatter plots with n points in order
to maximize the RGB distance among poitns.
